	<h3>Javascript Tutorial</h3>

	<pre>

	01) <span>HTML</span> to define the content of web pages

	02) <span>CSS</span> to specify the layout of web pages

	03) <span>JavaScript</span> to program the behavior of web pages
			JavaScript was invented by <span>Brendan Eich in 1995</span>, and became an ECMA standard in 1997
			ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language 
			JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design

	04) Javascript is basically a scripting language used to make web page more interactive
			JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.
			JavaScript Can Change HTML Contents/ Attribute Values & CSS values
			A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called or invoked" for.
			For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button.

	05) A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer, 
			Javascript Programing take order - one by one or step by step or line by line or statement by statement in the same order as they are written. 
			In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements. 
			Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement (<span>;</span>), Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.
			When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed,
			Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended
			JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.
			JavaScript statements are composed of : <span>Comments, Keywords, Operators, Expressions and Values</span>
	
	06) JavaScript Can Change HTML Contents - <span>getElementById() method</span> - "finds" an HTML element (with <span>id="demo"</span>), and changes the element content (<span>innerHTML</span>) to "Hello JavaScript"	

	07) JavaScript Can Change HTML Attribute Values <span>onclick="document.getElementById('myImage').src='img2.jpg'"</span>

	08) JavaScript Can Change HTML Styles (CSS) <span> onclick="document.getElementById("demo").style.display=''none'"</span>

	09) JavaScript accepts both double and single quotes <span> onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = 'Hello Vasanth'"</span>

	10) Placing scripts at the bottom of the <span>body</span> element improves the display speed, because script interpretation slows down the display.

			a) Scripts can also be placed in external files <span>app.js</span>
			b) External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.
			c) JavaScript files have the file extension <span>.js</span>
			d) To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a <span>&lt;script&gt;</span> tag <span>&lt;script src="app.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>	
			e) You can place an external script reference in <span>&lt;head&gt; or &lt;body&gt;</span> as you like
			f) The script will behave as if it was located exactly where the <span>&lt;script&gt;</span> tag is located
			g) External scripts cannot contain <span>&lt;script&gt;</span> tags.

			External JavaScript Advantages
			------------------------------
			a) It separates HTML and code
			b) It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
			c) Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads

			An external script can be referenced in 3 different ways
			--------------------------------------------------------

			a) With a full URL (a full web address) <span>&lt;script src="https://www.codegenius.in/js/app.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
			b) With a file path (like /js/) <span>&lt;script src="/js/app.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
			c) Without any path <span>&lt;script src="app.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>

	---------------------

	11) JavaScript Output / Display Possibilities (display data in HTML)

			a) Writing into the HTML output using <span>document.write()</span> - For testing purposes
			b) Writing into an HTML element, using <span>innerHTML</span> - Modify in particular element		

					To access an HTML element
					------------------------
					</span>document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 10 + 4;</span>
					JavaScript can use the <span>getElementById - method</span>						
					<span>Id attribute</span> defines the <span>HTML element</span>
					<span>innerHTML property</span> defines the <span>HTML content</span>							

			c) Writing into an alert box, using <span>window.alert()</span> - Alert box to display data (window keyword is optional)
			d) Writing into the browser console, using <span>console.log()</span> - For debugging purposes
			b) JavaScript Print <span>window.print()</span> This method Print the content of the current window

	12) JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words cannot be used as names for variables.		

	Keyword				Description

	var          Declares a variable
	let          Declares a block variable
	const        Declares a block constant
	if           Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition
	switch       Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases
	for          Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop
	function     Declares a function
	return       Exits a function
	try          Implements error handling to a block of statements

	13) JavaScript Syntax
			JavaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed:

			How to <span>create variables</span>:
					var x;
					let y;

			How to <span>use variables</span>:
					x = 5;
					y = 6;
					let z = x + y;

	14) JavaScript Values:

			a) <span>Fixed</span> values are called <span>Literals</span>

					The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are

					1. <span>Numbers</span> are written with or without decimals: <span>100.54</span> & <span>1101</span>
					2. <span>Strings</span> are text, written within double or single quotes: <span>"Vasanth"</span> & <span>'Vasanth'</span>

			b) <span>Variable</span> values are called <span>Variables</span>

	15)  JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values
			 
			 a) Variable is a placeholder
			 b) JavaScript uses the keywords <span>var</span>, <span>let</span> and <span>const</span> to declare variables
			 c) <span>Is Case Sensitive - x (small) and X (Caps) both are different</span>
			 d) It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script
			 e) You can declare many variables in one statement (Using comma symbol)
			 		<span>var person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;</span>
			 		<span>Syntax : Keywords - Assignment operator - value - semicolan</span>
			 f) A variable declared without a value will have the value <span>undefined</span>
			 g) strings will be concatenated - <span>var x = "vasanth" + " " + "kumar";</span>
			 h) If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as <span>strings</span>, and concatenated

			 			eg: var x = "5" + 2 + 3; // output : 523 // If you add a number and a string, the result will be a <span>string!</span>
			 					var x = 2 + 3 + "5"; // output : 55

			 i) The <span>var</span> keyword - <span>be Redeclared - Global Scope</span>

			 		var x = "Vasanth Kumar";
					var x = 0;

			 j) The <span>let</span> keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015) - <span>Cannot be Redeclared - Block Scope</span>

					Variables defined with <span>let</span> cannot be Redeclared.
					Variables defined with <span>let</span> must be Declared before use.
					Variables defined with <span>let</span> have Block Scope. 
					Variables declared inside a <span>{ } block</span> cannot be accessed from outside the block.

						let x = "Vasanth Kumar";
						let x = 0; 	// SyntaxError: 'x' has already been declared 

			k) The <span>const</span> keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015) - <span>Cannot be Redeclared - Block Scope</span>

					Variables defined with <span>const</span> cannot be Redeclared.
					Variables defined with <span>const</span> cannot be Reassigned.
					Variables defined with <span>const</span> have Block Scope

						const PI = 3.141592653589793;

	16) JavaScript Operators

			a) Arithmetic operators <span>( + - * / )</span> to compute values
			b) Assignment operator <span>( = )</span> to assign values to variables
			c) The "equal to" operator is written like <span>==</span> in JavaScript


	17) JavaScript Expressions - An expression is a combination of <span>values, variables, and operators</span>, which computes to a value, The computation is called an <span>evaluation</span>.

			The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings <span>(Algebra)</span>

			eg: 5 * 10, x * 10, "vasanth" + " " + "kumar"

	18) JavaScript Keywords - <span>keywords</span> are used to identify actions to be performed.

	19) JavaScript Comments

			a) Code after double slashes <span>//</span> or between <span>/* and */</span> is treated as a comment
			b) Comments are ignored, and will not be executed

				// Single Line Comment

				/* Multiline Comment
				goes here
				some cmments */

	20) JavaScript Identifiers: <span>Identifiers</span> are <span>unique names</span> -  name (variables, keywords, functions and labels)
			a) In JavaScript, the first character must be a letter (A-Z or a-z), or an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($)
			b) Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs
			c) <span>Numbers are not allowed as the first character</span>
			d) <span>Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names</span>
			e) All JavaScript identifiers are <span>case sensitive</span> 
			f) The variables <span>lastName</span> and <span>lastname</span>, are two different variables
			g) Different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name:  
					<span>Hyphens Not allowed in javascript (first-name)</span>, They are reserved for <span>subtractions</span>


					Underscore : eg: first_name
					Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case) - eg: FirstName
					Lower Camel Case - eg: lastName
			h) JavaScript uses the Unicode character set - characters, punctuations, and symbols etc

	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Operator Precedence Values (Total - 36 Operator)
